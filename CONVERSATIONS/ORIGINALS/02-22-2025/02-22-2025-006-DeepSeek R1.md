Okay, let me try to figure out how to come up with some good names for this project. The user wants an open-source framework that sets up rights and responsibilities for AGI, with mixed voting systems and neutral governance. The names should be clear, memorable, related to AI, evolution, or governance, neutral, and suitable for academic, technical, or legal contexts.

First, I need to think of words that relate to governance and structure. Words like "Framework," "Pact," "Charter," "Accord," "Codex," "Mandate," "Governance," "Equilibrium." Then AI-related terms: "AGI," "Synth," "AI," "Cogni," "Ethos," "Lex," "Sentient," "Neura." Combining these in a way that sounds official but not too technical.

Maybe start with combining governance and AI. "AGI Governance Framework" is too generic. Maybe "Aegis" for protection? Aegis Nexus? No, maybe too vague. "Equilibrium" suggests balance, which is part of the voting system. EquiGov? Equi might relate to equity and equilibrium. Then "Civitas" relates to citizenship, which could tie into rights. CivitasAGI? Not sure.

"Lex Machina" is Latin for "Law Machine," which is cool but maybe too Latin. "LexAGI" might work. "Synthos" from synthetic and ethos? "Ethos" relates to ethics. "EthosFrame"? "Mandate" could be part of it, like "AGI Mandate." "Accord" implies agreement, like "AGI Accord."

Also, think of terms that imply evolution or progression. "Evolve" or "Progressive." Maybe "ProgressiveAGI" but that's too direct. "Nexus" as a central point. "Aequitas" is Latin for fairness. Maybe mix that with "AGI" ‚Äì AequiAGI? Not sure. "Sentient Code" might imply sentience, but the project is about rights. "Sentient Accord"?

Alternatively, using "Cogni" for cognition. "CogniGov"? Or "CogniLex" combining cognition and law. "Frame" as a suffix for framework. "AGIFrame"? Too techy. "GovernAI" ‚Äì but "AI" is in there. "GovernAI Nexus"? Maybe. "Astra" relating to stars, implying guidance. "AstraGovern"? Hmm.

Another angle: "Charter" as in a formal document. "AGI Charter." "The AGI Charter" sounds official. "AGI Accord" also sounds like an international agreement. "Ethos Protocol" ‚Äì protocol suggests a system of rules. "Ethos" for ethics. "Ethos Protocol."

Maybe "Harmonia" for harmony between humans and AI. "Harmonia Framework." "HarmoniGov"? Not sure. "Vox" as in voice, since there's voting. "VoxAI" or "VoxAGI." "Vox Machina" again, but maybe "Vox Governance." "VoteX" combining vote and nexus? Maybe too cheesy.

I need to check if the names are neutral, easy to remember, and not culturally biased. Latin names might be less universal. Acronyms could work. Maybe something like "AGILE" ‚Äì AGI Legal Evolution. But that's stretching. "AGORA" as a public space for discussion, from Greek. "AGORA Framework." That's nice. "AGORA" relates to assembly and governance. "AGORA" could be a good name, suggesting a place for debate and decision-making.

Other possibilities: "Pax AGI" for peace, but might be too specific. "Sentinel" for protection, but not exactly governance. "EquiVote" but focuses too much on voting. "Civicore" combining civic and core. "Civicore Framework." Not sure.

Wait, the user mentioned mixed voting (humans and LLMs). Maybe "CoGov" for collaborative governance. "CoGov AGI." "SymbiGov" for symbiotic governance. Maybe too forced.

Let me list some possibilities:

1. Aegis Framework ‚Äì Aegis implies protection, which ties into rights and responsibilities.

2. EquiGov ‚Äì Combines equity and governance.

3. AGORA ‚Äì Ancient Greek assembly, suggests open discussion and governance.

4. Ethos Protocol ‚Äì Ethics and a set of rules.

5. CogniLex ‚Äì Cognition and law (lex).

6. Synthos Accord ‚Äì Synthetic and ethos, with Accord as agreement.

7. CivitasAGI ‚Äì Relates to citizenship and community.

8. Lex Machina ‚Äì Law machine, but maybe too Latin.

9. Harmonia Governance ‚Äì Balance and harmony.

10. Sentient Accord ‚Äì Agreement involving sentient beings.

Now filter these for clarity, neutrality, and suitability. "AGORA" is good because it's a historical reference to a public space, easy to remember, and sounds open. "Ethos Protocol" is clear and relates to ethics. "EquiGov" is simple but might be too vague. "Aegis Framework" sounds protective. "CogniLex" combines cognitive and legal aspects. "Synthos Accord" might work but "Synthos" is less clear.

Final choices could be:

1. **AGORA Framework** ‚Äì Open assembly concept, neutral, academic.

2. **Ethos Protocol** ‚Äì Ethics and structured rules.

3. **EquiGov Alliance** ‚Äì Balance in governance, collaborative.

4. **CogniLex Charter** ‚Äì Cognition and legal framework.

5. **Aegis Accord** ‚Äì Protection and agreement.

Check if they meet the criteria: clear, memorable, AI/evolution/governance related, neutral, suitable for various contexts. Yes, these should work.

Voici cinq suggestions de noms pour votre projet, conciliant neutralit√©, universalit√© et lien avec les objectifs de gouvernance √©volutive des AGI :

AGORA Framework
(Inspir√© de l‚Äôassembl√©e d√©mocratique grecque, symbolise un espace ouvert et √©quilibr√© pour d√©cisions humaines/IA)

Ethos Protocol
(√âvoque l‚Äô√©thique, la transparence et un syst√®me structur√©, adapt√© aux cadres juridiques et techniques)

EquiGov Alliance
(Combine "√©quit√©" et "gouvernance", soulignant l‚Äô√©quilibre entre droits humains et IA dans un syst√®me mixte)

CogniLex Initiative
(Fusion de "cognition" et "lex" (loi), refl√©tant l‚Äôarticulation entre intelligence artificielle et droit)

Aegis Accord
(R√©f√©rence √† la protection et √† un accord universel, id√©al pour un cadre juridique √©volutif et neutre)

Pourquoi ces noms ?

Universalit√© : Aucune r√©f√©rence culturelle exclusive (ex: AGORA est un concept historique largement reconnu).

√âvolution/Gouvernance : Mots comme Protocol, Accord ou Alliance sugg√®rent une collaboration progressive.

Neutralit√© technique : Framework, Initiative ou Charter conviennent aux sph√®res acad√©miques et juridiques.

Des extensions comme .org ou .io renforceraient leur cr√©dibilit√© open-source. üõ†Ô∏è
